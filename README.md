# autohotkey-windows-shortcuts
A place to put shortcuts in Windows for AutoHotkey. Mostly for mapping my pen buttons.

The script names should be obvious :). Feel free to PR me with whatever you come up with!

## Quick instructions on having these boot on load (because I always forget)
* Open Window's startup folder via pressing `Win+R`, then typing `shell:startup` and hitting `Enter`.
* Open the folder containing the AutoHotkey script you want to run on startup next to the "startup" folder.
* alt+drag the script to the startup folder. This will create a shortcut to the script.
That should be it! the script will now run on startup.
